It’s important you attend meetings that your manager arranges.</p>\n<p>Your manager will need to find out more about your reasons for being off work. They might ask you to see an occupational health adviser who specialises in the well-being of people at work. The health adviser will talk to you about any problems you’re facing and the reasons why you’re off work ill regularly. They may ask to see a medical report from your GP before writing up their report on your situation.</p>\n<p>Your manager will talk through the health adviser’s report with you and agree a plan to review your situation regularly. If you need support at work because of health issues, your manager will do what they can to help you. For example, they might change your working pattern for a limited time or your role at work so your attendance can improve.</p>\n<p>Your manager will arrange a follow up meeting to see whether you are back on track.</p>\n<h3>Stage 2 – formal meeting</h3>\n<p>If your absence hasn’t improved after the plan has been put into action, you’ll need to attend a formal meeting. You can take a work colleague with you or someone from your Union if you want to. If you haven't already spoken with occupational health, your manager might ask you to talk to a health adviser. Your manager will look at all the information and decide what to do next.</p>\n<p>This could include reducing your work hours or bringing in special equipment to help you at work.
