If you send the documents to HR in time we may be able to amend your tax code before your next payslip goes out. Also, if HM Revenue &#x26; Customs (HMRC) send you a tax code directly through the post, we won't be able to apply it, we'll need HMRC to contact us directly to tell us what the code is.</p>\n<h3>The wrong tax code</h3>\n<p>If HMRC issue an electronic tax code directly to you then there isn’t anything we can do to change it.
